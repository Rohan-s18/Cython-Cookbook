# Cython Cookbook
## Author: Rohan Singh
Repository for Learning Cython. Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex). It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself. The Cython language is a superset of the Python language that additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables and class attributes.
